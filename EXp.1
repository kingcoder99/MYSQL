Experiment 1: Using Variables and Expressions

Aim: Write a PL/SQL program that declares two numeric variables, assigns values to them,
calculates their sum, and prints the result.

Tools Used:
• PL/SQL: Procedural Language extensions to SQL for Oracle databases.
• DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE: A PL/SQL built-in procedure used to print output to the console.

Code:
SQL> set serveroutput on; 
SQL> DECLARE 
2     -- Declare two numeric variables 
3     num1 NUMBER := 25; 
4     num2 NUMBER := 35; 
5 
6     --Variable to store the sum 
7     sum_result NUMBER; 
8  BEGIN 
9     --Calculate the sum 
10    sum_result := num1 + num2; 
11 
12    --Print the result 
13    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('The sum of || num1 || and || num2 || is: ' || sum_result); 
14 END; 
15 /
The sum of 25 and 35 is: 60


Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this program, learners should be able to:
• Declare and initialize numeric variables in PL/SQL.
• Perform basic arithmetic operations (like addition) with variables.
• Output results to the console using DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE.

Conclusion:
This PL/SQL program demonstrates the basic usage of variables, arithmetic operations, and
output in PL/SQL. By declaring variables and performing a simple calculation (addition in this
case), students can understand how variables interact within the PL/SQL environment. This
is foundational knowledge for more complex PL/SQL programming.
